"""Persistent session goals — the Ralph loop for Hermes.

A goal is a free-form user objective that stays active across turns. After
each turn completes, a small judge call asks an auxiliary model "is this
goal satisfied by the assistant's last response?". If not, Hermes feeds a
continuation prompt back into the same session and keeps working until the
goal is done, turn budget is exhausted, the user pauses/clears it, or the
user sends a new message (which takes priority and pauses the goal loop).

State is persisted in SessionDB's ``state_meta`` table keyed by
``goal:<session_id>`` so ``/resume`` picks it up.

Design notes / invariants:

- The continuation prompt is just a normal user message appended to the
  session via ``run_conversation``. No system-prompt mutation, no toolset
  swap — prompt caching stays intact.
- Judge failures are fail-OPEN: ``continue``. A broken judge must not wedge
  progress; the turn budget is the backstop.
- When a real user message arrives mid-loop it preempts the continuation
  prompt and also pauses the goal loop for that turn (we still re-judge
  after, so if the user's message happens to complete the goal the judge
  will say ``done``).
- This module has zero hard dependency on ``cli.HermesCLI`` or the gateway
  runner — both wire the same ``GoalManager`` in.

Nothing in this module touches the agent's system prompt or toolset.

    judge couldn't be reached). ``wait_directive`` is set only for ``"wait"``
    (``{"pid": int}`` or ``{"seconds": int}``); ``None`` otherwise.

    ``parse_failed`` is True only when the judge call succeeded but its output
    was unusable (empty or non-JSON). API/transport errors return False — they
    are transient and should fail-open silently.

    ``transport_failed`` is True only when the judge couldn't reach the API at
    all (auth 401, timeout, DNS, connection error).  Repeated transport
    failures signal a permanent config problem (e.g. invalid API key).  Callers
    use this flag to auto-pause after N consecutive transport failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TRANSPORT_FAILURES``). Callers use this flag to
    auto-pause after N consecutive parse failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_PARSE_FAILURES``).

    ``subgoals`` is an optional list of user-added criteria (from
    ``/subgoal``) factored into the verdict. ``background_processes`` is the
    live ``process_registry.list_sessions()`` snapshot; when the agent is
    waiting on one (a CI poller, build, etc.) the judge can return a ``wait``
    verdict naming its pid, parking the loop instead of re-poking.
    ``contract`` is an optional structured completion contract; when present
    the judge decides DONE strictly against its Verification criterion and
    refuses completion when a Constraint was violated. All three are additive
    — a contract, subgoals, and a background-process list can coexist in one
    judge prompt; when none are set, behavior is identical to the original
    free-form judge.

    This is deliberately fail-open: transport errors return ``("continue", ..., ..., None, True)``
    — the ``transport_failed=True`` flag lets callers track and auto-pause after
    N consecutive transport failures (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TRANSPORT_FAILURES``) so a permanently broken

    """Drive a kanban worker through a Ralph-style goal loop.

    The dispatcher spawns a goal-mode worker exactly like a normal worker
    (``hermes -p <profile> chat -q "work kanban task <id>"``). The worker's
    first turn has already run by the time this is called; ``first_response``
    is that turn's reply. From here we:

    1. Check whether the worker already terminated the task (called
       ``kanban_complete`` / ``kanban_block``). If so, stop — nothing to do.
    2. Otherwise judge the latest response against ``goal_text`` (the card's
       title + body). ``continue`` → feed a continuation prompt and run
       another turn IN THE SAME SESSION via ``run_turn``. ``done`` but the
       task is still open → one explicit "call kanban_complete" nudge.
    3. When the turn budget is exhausted and the worker still hasn't
       terminated the task, ``block_fn`` is invoked so the card lands in a
       sticky ``blocked`` state for human review (NOT a silent exit).

    This function performs NO SessionDB persistence — a worker process is
    ephemeral, so the turn budget lives in a local counter. It is fully
    decoupled from the CLI for testability: callers inject ``run_turn``
    (str -> str), ``task_status_fn`` (() -> str|None), and ``block_fn``
    (reason: str -> None).

    Returns a decision dict: ``{"outcome", "turns_used", "reason"}`` where
    outcome is one of ``"completed_by_worker"``, ``"review_requested_by_worker"``,
    ``"changes_requested_by_reviewer"``, ``"blocked_budget"``,
    ``"blocked_by_worker"``, or ``"stopped"``.
